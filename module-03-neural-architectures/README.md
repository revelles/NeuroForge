# Module 03: Neural Architectures

## Goals
- Implement classic neural architectures from scratch (CNN, GAN, AE, RNN).
- Understand their structure, training dynamics, and use cases.
- Compare performance across problem types.

## Weekly Plan
- Week 9: CNNs (e.g., MNIST classifier)
- Week 10: Autoencoders (compression/denoising)
- Week 11: GANs (image synthesis)
- Week 12: RNNs or LSTMs (sequences)

## Deliverables
- ðŸ§  2 working models (e.g., GAN + AE)
- ðŸŽ¥ Training visualizations or latent space plots
